// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and set it to 'Dane' as a string.
// we check if the name is equal to 'Mary' and if it is, we would log 'Hi Mary' or else we will log 'how do you do?'
// since the correct name is 'Dane', the log would show 'how do you do?'
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called 'secret'
// We also make another variable called 'code' and set its value to 123 as a number 
// we would then check if the variable 'code' equals to 123, if it is, we would set secret to 'super' as a string and 'code' would be set to code times two as a number.
// We would check if the variable 'code' is greater than the number 250, if it is, we would then set 'secret to 'duper' as a string.
// We would now console log 'secret' and we would get a result of 'super' becuase the 2nd condition wasn't met becasue 246 is less then 250 and not greater.
//

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable called isStudent and set it to 'true' as a boolean value.
// We create another variable called age and set its value to 34 as a number
// we create another variable called zip and set its value to 55407 as a number as well.
// We would check if isStudent is equals to true and if the zip is greater than 8000. If it is, then we would log 'You're a student on the west coast!.
// Otherwise, we would check if isStudent equals to false or if age is less than 30.
// if neither of those two above conditions is true, then we will console log 'What ar your hobbies?'
// or we will check if isStudent is equal to true, then console log 'Welcome to Prime!'
// otherwise, it would automatically console log 'How is the weather?' if none of the conditions above has been met.
//

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;
